            <p>China’s 2020 national census indicated that China has nearly 200 million people 65 years or older, accounting for nearly 14% of the country’s total population.  China’s senior care market is predicted to reach $800 billion by 2025, and the figure is expected to exceed $3 trillion by 2030. 

                China follows a ’90-7-3’ senior care model (90% caregivers at home, 7% in intermediate facilities, and 3% in nursing homes).  This approach is driving demand for both professional nursing and rehabilitation services and smart products and solutions. </p>
